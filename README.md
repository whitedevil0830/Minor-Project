# Minor-Project

### This repository includes the files and folders that was used while making my minor project which included a speech to speech bot and this bot was having several features which included: 
    - making of bucket lists of places to visit 
    - adding, deleting or modifying any item from the list
    - interacting with the user based on some predefined keywords (like what to respond when said "hello" & etc..)
### This list then is forwarded to algorithms like NN (Nearest Neighbour) and AntColony distance algorithms to predict and suggest the path including the places (from the list) that one needs to follow to travel optimally (based on time or money optimization)
